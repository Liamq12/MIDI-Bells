# MIDI-Bells
Code for my MIDI Controlled Bells Project
# Credits
Code modified from examples by <a href="https://www.partsnotincluded.com/controlling-musical-floppy-drives-directly-via-midi/">partsnotincluded.com</a> adapted for use with solenoids.
# Requirements
Arduino Mega <br/>
ESP32
Hairless MIDI
Loop MIDI
MIDI Player
Multi Channel Relay Boards
# Use
Using this is super easy! Simply install all the software above, and connect Hairless MIDI to the same COM port as the ESP32. Then use a MIDI player to send midi data to the ESP32 and watch as your relay boards click away!
# Note
This description is very skimpy, and that is just because I have not finished building the enclosure for the bells, but I figured it would be good to get my code out there as there was not really anything like it I could find. Once I finish this project ill write a step by step how to guide with pictures.
